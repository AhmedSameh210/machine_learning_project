## Spotify Song Popularity Prediction Project

### Project Overview
This project aims to predict the popularity of songs on Spotify using machine learning techniques. It consists of two main phases: regression to predict the popularity percentage and classification to predict the popularity level. The project involves multiple stages including data preparation, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

### Project Components
The project includes the following components:

1. **Data Preparation:** Cleaning and organizing the Spotify song dataset.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing data to enhance model performance.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzing and visualizing data to gain insights.
4. **Preprocessing:** Scaling, encoding, and preparing data for modeling.
5. **Feature Selection:** Identifying the most relevant features for model training.
6. **Regression Models:** Implementing 15 regression models for predicting popularity percentage.
7. **Classification Models:** Employing 11 classification models to predict popularity levels.
8. **Model Selection Techniques:** Using 4 techniques to select the best classification models.
9. **Regression Selection Techniques:** Utilizing 10 techniques for selecting the most effective regression models.
10. **Voting and Stacking:** Employing ensemble techniques (voting and stacking) to combine multiple models for improved predictions.
11. **Model Training and Evaluation:** Training models on the data and evaluating their performance using appropriate metrics.

### Deployment
The project is deployed using Streamlit and can be accessed [here](https://deploypy-8bue937evs9fxgpxvcppss.streamlit.app/). The deployed app allows users to interact with the model and make predictions on song popularity.

### Usage
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AhmedSameh210/machine_learning_project.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Explore the project notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to understand each stage of the project.

4. Use the provided scripts in the `scripts/` directory for testing purposes.

5. Access the deployed app through the provided Streamlit link for interactive predictions.

### Conclusion
This project showcases a comprehensive approach to predicting song popularity on Spotify, leveraging various machine learning techniques and ensemble methods. The collaboration of the team members and the guidance of Dr. Dina Khattab have been instrumental in the successful execution of this project.
